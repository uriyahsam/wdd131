            <p> 
                My name is Uriyah, and I am passionate about software development and cybersecurity.  
                With a strong foundation in web technologies, I am constantly exploring new tools and techniques to enhance  
                my skills. My journey in technology has been fueled by a desire to create secure, efficient,  
                and user-friendly applications. I have earned professional certificates in cybersecurity and full-stack development,  
                and I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho.  
                Beyond coding, I enjoy playing the guitar, singing, and sharing knowledge with others.

            <p> 
                In WDD 131, my goal is to strengthen my understanding of dynamic web fundamentals  
                by mastering essential concepts such as responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and modern development practices.  
                I aim to build well-structured, accessible, and visually appealing websites that provide great user experiences.  
                Additionally, I plan to deepen my knowledge of front-end frameworks and best practices to create  
                scalable and efficient web applications. By the end of this course, I hope to apply these skills  
                to real-world projects, further solidifying my path in software development.
